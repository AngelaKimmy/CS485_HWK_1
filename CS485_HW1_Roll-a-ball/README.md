Future Improvements
If given more time, I would like to figure out how to make the enemies solid while still being a trigger, and maybe even swap the models for something more exciting. I would also like to add lives to the game as well as a game over screen. Designing multiple levels would also be very interesting. This project was very enjoyable, I ended up adding more features than I expected to and learned a lot just by exploring and using a couple of resources.
